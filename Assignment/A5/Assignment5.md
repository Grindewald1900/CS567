**Some background**  
With the rapid development of CPU manufacturing technology, it has become more and more difficult to improve the single core performance, that's why CPU manufacturers turned to develop multicore processors. As consequence, people began to put more effort on parallel computing research, which means a problem can be solved by more than one processors simultaneously. In this way, reconfiguration was raised to satisfy the need of this kind of problems. Compared with traditional models, reconfigurable models can make better use of hardware resources, that means the processors could be used to run the tasks when available. As a result, reconfigurable models make it possible to solve the problem in a more efficient and quicker way.

**The Defination of RMBM**

The Reconfigurable Multiple Bus Machine (RMBM), is one of the models for reconfiguration.
**Some Variants**

**Relation between RMBM and shared memory models**
